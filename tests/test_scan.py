"""Tests for the zero-ceremony directory scan.

The behaviour under test that matters most: a metric that cannot be computed
must be reported as inapplicable, never as 0.00. Silently scoring an unscanned
codebase as perfect is the exact failure mode the instrument exists to expose.

Security and complexity used to be Python-only, so a TypeScript project was
reported as inapplicable across the board. They now read JavaScript and
TypeScript as well, so the same project gets real scores, and the inapplicable
path is reserved for source the tool genuinely cannot read.
