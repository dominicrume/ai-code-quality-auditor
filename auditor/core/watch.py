"""Continuous audit — re-score a directory as it changes.

``scan`` answers "what is the state of this code?". ``watch`` answers the
question that actually matters while an agent is working: *what did that
change do to it?* Drift is visible as it happens rather than discovered
afterwards.

Change detection is by polling file mtime and size. This is deliberate:
a filesystem-event library would add a dependency and platform-specific
behaviour to save a stat() sweep that costs milliseconds on any codebase
this instrument is meant for.
