"""Zero-ceremony audit of any directory.

The experiment path (``auditor run`` / ``auditor experiment``) exists to
serve a controlled study: fixed spec, isolated workspace, one condition per
capture. That rigour is right for the dissertation and wrong as a front
door — it forces a user to decide, before writing a line, that this folder
is The Session.

``scan`` inverts that. Point it at a directory that already exists, however
the code got there, and it reports what it can actually measure.

The design rule that matters: **a metric is reported only where it applies.**
Bandit and radon read Python; on a TypeScript project they will happily
return 0.00, and printing that as a score would be a lie of exactly the kind
this instrument exists to catch. Inapplicable metrics are reported as
``n/a`` with the reason, never as a zero.
