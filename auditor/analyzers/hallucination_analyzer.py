"""Hallucination: features in the produced code that are NOT in the spec.

Two paths:
  1. If ``codebase["manifest"]`` is non-empty, trust it (the human_control
     adapter declares this by hand): hallucinations = |manifest - spec|.
  2. Otherwise auto-derive from the code itself (manifest_deriver) and
     count detected endpoints that do not map to any spec feature. This
     unblocks the metric for agentic adapters that do not emit a manifest.
