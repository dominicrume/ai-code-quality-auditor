"""Auto-derive a feature manifest from a generated codebase.

Why this exists
---------------
The hallucination metric needs to know which spec features the worker
*claims* to have shipped, plus any features shipped that were NOT in the
spec (scope drift / "helpful overreach"). Asking the agent to emit an
explicit manifest is unreliable across vendors, so we scan the produced
code for evidence of each spec feature.

What we look for
----------------
1. **Evidence of each spec feature** — token match on the feature id's
   dotted parts (e.g. ``course.list`` needs both ``course``/``courses``
   and ``list``/``lists`` to appear somewhere in the codebase).
2. **Hallucinated endpoints** — any of:
   * a FastAPI/Flask/Express route declaration that doesn't map to a
     spec feature (web-app shape)
   * an argparse subparser / Click command that doesn't map to a spec
     feature (CLI shape)

The CLI detection was added after the run_001 main study revealed that
the Replit Agent shipped a CLI for the ``internal_tool_cli`` spec but
its commands (``run``, ``schedule``, ``load_config``) had no overlap
with the spec's commands (``init``, ``add``, ``list``, ``export``,
``validate``, ``help``). Without CLI detection the hallucination metric
was structurally blind to that finding.
